# Initial of the scene


## Objectives

The objective of this scenario is to understand how people will react when put together in a room and try to get the best temperature for all. This includes the room description, people descriptions, and we'll try and identify how people will collaborate, or not.

## Room description

The conference room is nestled on the fourth floor of a sleek tertiary office building, overlooking the bustling city streets below. Bathed in natural light, the walls are adorned with abstract paintings that add a pop of color to the otherwise minimalist space. The room is well-sized, with a long rectangular table in the center, surrounded by comfortable ergonomic chairs. A sleek projector screen is mounted on one side, ready to display presentations and charts. The polished wooden floor lends an air of sophistication to the room, while soundproof walls ensure privacy during important meetings.

Flanking the walls are large double-pane windows, which offer a panoramic view of the surrounding cityscape. These windows, while provide breathtaking views, also play a significant role in the room's temperature. During the spring season, the windows are often cracked open to let in a gentle breeze, allowing the room to be filled with the refreshing scent of blooming flowers. However, they can also contribute to fluctuations in the air temperature, making it a factor that needs to be considered when setting the thermostat.

Prominently placed on the wall is the sleek, modern thermostat, equipped with a digital display and intuitive controls. With just a touch of a button, the occupants of the conference room have the power to set their desired temperature and control the room's climate. The thermostat is programmed to deliver optimal comfort, but individual preferences often prompt discussions and debates regarding the right temperature for the room.

Adding to the list of objects that influence air temperature and quality, there is also an AC controller neatly placed on the wall next to the thermostat. The AC controller allows for precise adjustments of the air conditioning system, ensuring that the room remains cool and comfortable even on the warmest of days. It serves as an alternative control option, empowering the occupants to take charge of the room's temperature in a more hands-on manner. Whether it's precision temperature control or simply refreshing the air, the AC controller becomes a key player in the quest to strike the right balance in the conference room's atmosphere.
